#### Advantages
1. Rather than routing the call to an RM that does not have any solution towards the customer's query. The new information system will be able to provide a better customer experience as calls will be routed to the RM with the appropriate product knowledge to help address the customer needs properly. 
2. In addition, rather than not accepting the call of a customer when the CMC is busy the customer will be routed to an interactive voice response where they can specify their needs so the system can generate a better script and guideline for when it is routed to a RM.
3. Enhanced productivity as the RM will have the potential buyers personal and purchase history information. Guidelines and a script will be displayed for the RM beforehand to help them have a smarter conversation with the customer. Making the interaction more comprehensive and customised. 
4. This also results in Enhanced customer satisfaction by reducing RM preparation time by generating guidelines and script to help the RM.
5. Increased efficiency  as the RM will not have to waste time to find a new customer to call each time they are finished with the previous one.
6. Increased customer satisfaction via the handling of calls efficiently and understanding customer needs well
Reinforcing customer loyalty by prioritising customers based on their likelihood to purchase holiday packages.  
7. All the above advantages from acquiring new customers to enhancing and retaining existing customer relationships will increase sales for the business.
8. As productivity and efficiency are enhanced, there will be less time and resources required to manage customers queries, ultimately it will reduce the operational costs for the business. 


#### There are four types of information system failure. 
1. Process failure: when the project cannot be developed within the allocated budget or time frame
2. Correspondence failure: when the objectives and goals of the systems design are not met 
3. Expectation failure: when the system doesn't meet user expectations or requirements
4. Interaction failure: this is attributed to the level of end-user usage of the implemented information system


Effects
* Each of the above failures will cause huge financial loss to the business. Information system projects require a huge amount of money to develop and implement in terms of capital and labour. 
* Another effect on the business is the difficulty to increase sales and potentially loss of customers and revenue streams without the streamline effect of the new information system.
