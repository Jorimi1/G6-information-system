### Advantages
Rather than routing the call to an RM that does not have any solution towards the customer's query. The new information system will be able to provide a better customer experience as calls will be routed to the RM with the appropriate product knowledge to help address the customer needs properly. 
The new system will enhance productivity as the RM will have the potential buyers information, guidelines and a script beforehand to help them have a smarter conversation with the customer. Making the interaction more comprehensive and customised. 
Handling calls efficiently and understanding customer needs will improve customer satisfaction. 
Reinforcing customer loyalty by prioritising customers based on their likelihood to purchase holiday packages. All the above advantages from acquiring new customers to enhancing and retaining existing customer relationships will increase sales for the business.
As productivity and efficiency are enhanced, there will be less time and resources required to manage customers queries, ultimately it will reduce the cost for the business. 



### There are four types of information system failure. 
Process failure: when the project cannot be developed within the allocated budget or time frame.
Correspondence failure: when the objectives and goals of the systems design are not met. 
Expectation failure: when the system doesn't meet user expectations or requirements.
Interaction failure: this is attributed to the level of end-user usage of the implemented information system.

### Effects
Each of the above failures will cause huge financial loss to the business. Information system projects require a huge amount of money to develop and implement in terms of capital and labour. 
Another effect on the business is the difficulty to increase sales and potentially loss of customers and revenue streams without the streamline effect of the new information system.
