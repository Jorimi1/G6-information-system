### Objective 4. Explain the agile methodology, namely, Scrum you have used to carry out the procedure. In your explanation, ensure that you outline activities from Scrum that you use. 

#### Agile
Agile methodology stems from the failures of the waterfall model and its inability to adapt to the fast paced changing nature of the modern world. Agile development follows a range of philosophies and guidelines, which can be aptly described by the Agile Manifesto:
* Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools
* Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation
* Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation
* Responding to change over Following a plan

By valuing the items on the left more than those on the right, Agile results in a highly iterative and incremental system development process, achieving a workable product when an iteration is complete.

#### Scrum and Scrum Activities
An example of an Agile methodology is SCRUM, which we will be using to carry out the creation of The System. It features Sprints, which are periods between 14-30 days to develop a workable product including design, coding, testing and documentation. The most common way of describing Scrum is breaking it into its components, which consist of: 3 Roles, 4 Events and 3 Artefacts. 

The 3 Roles make up a basic Scrum team and is composed of: 
* The Product Owner
* The Scrum Master 
* The Development Team. 

The Product Owner is a single person which allows for faster decision making and clearer lines of responsibility. The Scrum Master acts like a referee for the Product Owner and the Development Team, responsible for ensuring Scrum methodology is understood and used correctly. The Development Team builds the workable product during each Sprint. It is autonomous and has no defined hierarchy. 

Activities that we will be conducting during the making of the system revolves around the 4 events that make up Scrum, which are: 
* Spring Planning
* Sprint Review
* Sprint Retrospective
* Daily Scrum Meeting 

During sprint planning, we were able to define our goals and what we were to achieve with the work that we were assigned. We broke up each section into different weeks. During week 1 of the sprint, we were able to create an empathy map and list all of the different stakeholders. In week 2, we decided to complete a design thinking principles and all of the different user cases involved with the users stories. In week 3, we concluded that we had to get all of the models and diagrams done. In week 4, we were going to list the competitive advantages and its effects on the holiday package system. We hosted scrum meetings on a regular basis to see our accomplishments.

By using sprint review, we were able to assess the work that we have done by that given week and what has not been completed. In doing this we were able to come to a conclusion of what we had to do next week to complete the task by the due date. In conjunction with sprint review, we used a sprint retrospect to find ways for our team to improve as a whole and see what we have to do by the following week. 

The three artifacts that make up the scrum that we have used in determining the goals of the holiday package system are:
*Product backlog
*Sprint backlog
*Sprint burndown chart
 
In a product backlog, it contains an ordered list of everything that might be needed in a product. This may include requirements for the said product. By understanding the requirement of the product we were able to extract different stakeholders involved with the product and understand how each of them feels about the given product. We developed an empathy map to understand the different requirements for all of the different stakeholders. This includes how they feet, what they say, what they hear, what they do and what they see about the product. We were able to also come up with a problem definition for us to solve and finish.
