### Objective 4. Explain the agile methodology, namely, Scrum you have used to carry out the procedure. In your explanation, ensure that you outline activities from Scrum that you use. 

#### Agile
Agile methodology stems from the failures of the waterfall model and its inability to adapt to the fast paced changing nature of the modern world. Agile development follows a range of philosophies and guidelines, which can be aptly described by the Agile Manifesto:
* Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools
* Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation
* Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation
* Responding to change over Following a plan

By valuing the items on the left more than those on the right, Agile results in a highly iterative and incremental system development process, achieving a workable product when an iteration is complete.

#### Scrum and Scrum Activities
An example of an Agile methodology is SCRUM, which we will be using to carry out the creation of The System. It features Sprints, which are periods between 14-30 days to develop a workable product including design, coding, testing and documentation. The most common way of describing Scrum is breaking it into its components, which consist of: 3 Roles, 4 Events and 3 Artefacts. 

The 3 Roles make up a basic Scrum team and is composed of: 
* The Product Owner
* The Scrum Master 
* The Development Team. 

The Product Owner is a single person which allows for faster decision making and clearer lines of responsibility. The Scrum Master acts like a referee for the Product Owner and the Development Team, responsible for ensuring Scrum methodology is understood and used correctly. The Development Team builds the workable product during each Sprint. It is autonomous and has no defined hierarchy. 

Activities that we will be conducting during the making of the system revolves around the 4 events that make up Scrum, which are: 
* Spring Planning
* Sprint Review
* Sprint Retrospective
* Daily Scrum Meeting 

Sprints start with planning,
