Advantages
Rather than routing the call to an RM that does not have any solution towards the customer's query. The new information system will be able to provide a better customer experience as calls will be routed to the RM with the appropriate product knowledge to help address the customer needs properly . 
Enhanced productivity as the RM will have the potential buyers information, guidelines and a script beforehand to help them have a smarter conversation with the customer. The interaction will be more comprehensive and customised. Handling calls efficiently and understanding customer needs will improve customer satisfaction. 
Able to prioritise customers based on their likelihood to purchase holiday packages. This reinforces customer loyalty and ultimately leads to better sales. 
As productivity and efficiency are enhanced, there will be less time and resources required to manage customers queries, ultimately it will reduce the cost for the business. 




Effects
When the system doesn't meet user expectations or inability to create a functioning system. One of the main effects on the business is the huge financial loss incurred. Information system projects require a huge sum of money to implement in terms of capital and labour. 
Difficult to increase sales and potentially loss of customers and revenue streams without the streamline effect of the new information system.
